## Project description
It's a small application that fetches data about Pokemons from an external API, displays detaills of a Pokemon when a user clicks on the name and allows the user to search for a specific Pokemon by name.

## Project dependencies
I worked with JS, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

## API for the application
API: https://pokeapi.co/

## User Stories for the application
As a user, I want to click on the name of the Pokemon I am interested in to see more details about this specific Pokemon.

As a user, I want to type the name of the Pokemon into the Search bar and click enter or the Search button to see this specific Pokemon and not scroll through the whole list.
